# Neural Network Code
## About:
This is a folder containing my projects as I learn about neural networks. In the resources I include links to the main resources I used as I learned about neural networks. 

## Additional Information
### Projects so Far:
1. [Maze Generation:](https://github.com/justinwlin/p5/tree/master/MazeGeneration) A self-initiated project as an attempt to create a genetic algorithm to solve a maze.
    - Genetic algorithm code executes properly but population became too homogenous. 
    - Hope to revisit to improve the genetic algorithm to get it working properly: [Read readme file for more information](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/blob/master/MazeGeneration/README.MD)
2. [Perceptron: ](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/tree/master/CC_Perceptron) 
    - I built a basic perceptron to learn linear regression. [Readme file for more information on what I learned](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/blob/master/CC_Perceptron/README.MD)

3. [Neural Network Using Python and Numpy](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural_Network_Numpy)
    - In order to prove I had an proficient understanding of neural network, I worked by myself to reimplement a neural network with 1 input layer, 2 hidden layer, and 1 output layer using Python and the Numpy math library for matrix calculations.
    - Apply concepts from gradient descent, feed-forward and backpropogation, and matrix math to build a supervised learning neural network model.

## Resources
### [Shiffman Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw):
    - Tutorials that cover from beginning to end about the implementation of neural networks using p5 in javascript and processing using Java. 

### [3Blue1Brown Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi):

    - A youtube series that covers the mathematical principles behind neural network and was a great resources in order to wrap my head around the mathematical aspects of programming a neural network as I became stuck on topics like backpropogation.
