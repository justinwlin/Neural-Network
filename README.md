## About:
This is a folder containing my projects from the tutorial series by Shiffman. My goal with the project is go learn more Javascript along with creating and learning deep learning and genetic algorithms. There will be proper readme files for projects that are from me following his tutorials, my modification to the files, or any self-driven projects. 

## Additional Information
### Projects so Far:
1. Maze Generation: An attempt at creating a genetic algorithm to solve a maze.
    - Genetic algorithm code executes properly but population became too homogenous. Read readme file in the project for more information.
