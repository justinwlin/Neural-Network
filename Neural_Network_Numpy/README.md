#Supervised Deep Neural Network Model

## About:
This is a deep neural network that I programmed using Python and the Numpy math library in order to learn how to build a neural network for supervise learning. 

In order to test the model, I am training the neural network to learn how to categorize XOR inputs. 

### Structure of the Neural Network:
The structure of the neural network has 1 input layer, 2 hidden layer, and one output layer. 
The number of nodes per layer can be modified to whatever is needed. 

## How to Run:
Download the file, either copying/pasting or downloading the repository, and run it using Python 3.0 or greater.
