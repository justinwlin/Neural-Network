# Flappy Bird Neural Network:

## DISCLAIMER: 
This is a Github project following a tutorial series by Daniel Shiffman ( [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6y21FkaUqw) ) on how to apply a neural network + genetic algorithm to play flappy bird. 

Credits to him for the files: nn.js, matrix.js, and the flappy bird code. 

## About:
This was a learning experience to learn how to further apply neural networks + genetic algorithm together. 

## What I hope to do for future improvements:
What I hope to do in the future to improve on Daniel Shiffman code is that instead of just "copying" over the most successful birds over, and having that be the way the "genes" or the "brains" of the birds are based along, is to modify the neural network library to allow two neural networks to be passed in and to average the values. 

My hope would be that this would come closer to a solution to play better. 

I also might consider having different "species" of birds, with different amounts of layers, inputs, outputs, and try to see which one works better in the future.
